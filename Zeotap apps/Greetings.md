	Hi Zeotap company 1stly thank you so much for giving an opportunity to participate in recruitement process.
I really enjoyed a lot. Learnt so many things and I sincerely thank chat GPT for helping me build these apps.
I would really enjoy being a part of this software company where even the recruitement process is amazing, never seen something like this. Hoping this is where is dreamt of working.
There are more read me files inside the subdirectories of each apps. I thing i have written every essential that helps the user or a tester to launch the application.


Experience : 
	Basically I have used reactapp, which I dint' want use because of the memory space it consumes.
I tried using fastapi and flask but all i wanted is to finish my project. All the modules are inbuilt so it wasnt hard as compared to build an app with other APIs and fronts. Building this app was very difficult and I dedicated for this app and havent been to college for the whole 10 days and I took my teachers help to add security layer. 

Security :
	googleapi security layer was added in 1st app whereas not in 2nd app because the deadline was very near and 
I'm sincerely sorry for it.


Thank you zeotap ones more for giving me such a great opportunity. Hoping for the best ;)
